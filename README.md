I am a Senior Full Stack Engineer with 6+ years of experience delivering scalable, secure, and high-performance applications across fintech, healthcare, media, and enterprise environments. I specialise in React, Next.js, Node.js, Python, GraphQL, and AWS - building modern products that balance performance, maintainability, and strong user experience.

My work spans full-stack development, system design, cloud architecture, AI/LLM integration, and DevOps automation. I’ve delivered production-ready systems for global organisations such as NBCUniversal, National Grid, Cancer Awareness Trust, Philips Healthcare, Trustly, NinjaOne, the São Paulo Government, and several Brazilian enterprise brands.

I enjoy solving complex engineering problems, modernising legacy systems, improving developer experience, and creating intelligent features using LLMs, RAG pipelines, LangChain, and AWS Bedrock. I thrive in collaborative environments and value clean architecture, automation, and thoughtful engineering practices.

Always learning, always building - and always excited about using modern technology to deliver real business impact.
